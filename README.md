EEM Online is a minimal custom integration for electricity consumption published by
Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira. It configures one login and one contract through
the Home Assistant UI.

The integration polls every 12 hours. It exposes the latest available daily consumption
and cumulative meter reading, each with its operator date as an attribute. Daily
consumption is also imported as an external long-term statistic for the Energy Dashboard.

## Current scope

- one EEM login and one contract per config entry;
- daily consumption from `resumo/ultimasemana`;
- the latest cumulative meter reading from the last 30 complete days of `leituras`;
- a seven-day overlapping correction window;
- two read-only sensors with `consumption_date` and `reading_date` attributes;
- one external statistic: `eem_online:<contract>_consumption`.

Fifteen-minute samples, individual meter registers, locally retained reading history,
billing, prices, production, export, one entry managing multiple contracts, options,
actions, and repair flows are outside this version.

## Installation

EEM Online requires Home Assistant 2026.9.2 or newer and HACS 2.0.5 or newer.

### Install through HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the EEM Online repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=zewelor&repository=ha-eem-pt&category=integration)

1. Select the button above and open the link in your Home Assistant instance.
2. In HACS, select **Download**.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

If the button does not open the repository, add it manually:

1. Open HACS and select the three-dot menu in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Custom repositories**.
3. Enter `https://github.com/zewelor/ha-eem-pt` and select **Integration** as the
   category.
4. Select **Add**, open **EEM Online**, and select **Download**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Add the integration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up EEM Online](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=eem_online)

Select the button above, or open **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration**
and search for **EEM Online**.

Enter the EEM Online username, password, and numeric electricity contract number. The
integration validates the credentials and checks that the configured contract endpoint
returns a supported response before creating the entry.

To monitor another contract from the same EEM Online account, add the integration again
with the same credentials and the other contract number. Home Assistant keeps each
contract as an independent integration entry with its own sensors and Energy statistic.

## Energy Dashboard

Open **Settings > Dashboards > Energy**, add an electricity grid consumption source,
and select the statistic named **EEM Online `<contract>` consumption**. The Energy
Dashboard uses the imported historical statistic; the latest-daily-consumption sensor
is only a compact status view. The meter-reading sensor is also for display only and
must not be added as a second consumption source.

## Data assumptions

EEM Online does not publish a supported public API. The MVP currently interprets the
sum of `consumoCheias`, `consumoVazio`, and `consumoPonta` as kWh for the civil date in
`data`, in the `Atlantic/Madeira` time zone. Local PoC observations support that shape,
but the daily-summary date semantics still need confirmation. A live, anonymized
`leituras` check confirmed the `data` timestamp, numeric `totalRegistadores`, and
pagination shape; the portal labels meter readings in kWh and reports production in a
separate field. Zero daily consumption is not imported because the weekly response does
not prove that a zero-valued day is complete.

## Development

The project structure and development tooling are based on the
[HACS Integration Blueprint](https://github.com/jpawlowski/hacs.integration_blueprint).
